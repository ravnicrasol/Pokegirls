### Introduction  
**What’s the breed’s origins/discovery? Did they have an appearance/impact in the war (if it applies)? What are their distinguishing physical attributes?** 

(More mature version of elves, during the war they were considered deadly snipers capable of shooting down targets without even being seen)

### Society
**How do these pokegirls tend to live in normal society? What uses/jobs do they tend to gravitate towards? Does there tend to be perceptions about them that are true? False? Exaggerated? Have there been in-Famous/Distinguishable events involving this breed?**

(Generally, work for watchers and the military also found commonly as sentries doing sniper duty. In courts they’re captains to elf units)

### The Individual
**Does the breed have a tendency to show certain personality traits? Taming preferences? How the breed typically interacts with others in the harem? What needs/quirks does the pokegirl have that a tamer should be aware of? What could be a good way to handle them? Is there any particular role or activity the breed is known to enjoy/hate?**

(Stoic, distant… kuudere. Generally keeps a calm demeanour)

### Fighting
**Do they fight? What is a commonly found strategy they tend to use during a battle? What are their strengths and weaknesses? What should be one’s approach to defeat them? How could one improve their combat prowess?**

(Preference for long range, but capacity for things like swords. Incredible grip and arm strength, sort of necessary as it helps them save some energy on having to boost their archery range)

### Feral
**How do ferals of this breed act? What habitat do they prefer? Are there other breeds they’ve been found to interact with (negatively/positively)? Does it tend to be solitary or does the breed tend to move in groups? What’s something to look out for when encountering a feral of this breed? What strategies usually work best for capturing them?**

(General sleepiness and lethargy, not full hibernation, but spends a lot more time sleeping and the like. Still dangerous)

### Threshold
**Is it possible to threshold into this breed? Are threshold cases into this breed frequent? With what ancestry usually results in turning into this breed? How long does it take? Are there early signs? What about precautions one should take when undergoing threshold into this pokegirl? What’s the best way to handle a thresholded pokegirl in your harem?**

(Unheard of, no records exist, it’s suspected as possible if one has plant and magic ancestry, but it’s still dubious)












### Original Entry

If the Elf is the foot soldier and grunt fighter of the elven court, then the High Elf is noble warrior. Magically she becomes much more powerful than before. Though her skill is not on the level of the true mages of the Elf Court, she could certainly hold her own in a magical battle. The High Elf is very similar in appearance to the Elf. They grow about a foot, and become slimmer. Sometimes they may increase a cup size, but this rare. They like having their hair long, but not so long that it becomes a hinderance. High Elves are treated as a Ranger might in pre-Sukebe medieval times. They are far below the queen or her advisors, but well above the regular Elves. Some Elfqueens have them as the royal guard, and others employ them as scouts, having them sweep the area around the Elf Court for intruders.


High Elves are very logical. At first glance they appear to be coldly logical, however should a Tamer break through this shell they will find that, while they are in extreme control of their emotions and are strong proponents of logic, they are extremely loyal, hardworking, and loving pokégirls. High Elves are so strong, mentally, and in such control of their emotions and thoughts, that the stronger ones are capable of resisting psychic probes, though this does not give them any defense against psychic attacks. While Feral, they lose some intelligence and lot of control over their emotions. They will make heavy-handed innuendoes when speaking, a point that is an extreme point of embarrassment. They are devils in bed, the only other time they lower their wall of logic, though they cannot last as long as some other pokégirls.


A High Elf is a long to mid-range fighter, but they can fight up close if need be. They are topnotch archers, almost on the level of Herowu’s, if that is their chosen weapon. Their eyesight allows them to see long distance for their arrow shots. High Elves may magically enchant their arrows with elemental properties, allowing them to strike as an attack of the chosen element. While at first restricted to the elements of Fire, Lightning, and Plant, a willing, experienced Pokégirl may teach a High Elf how to harness an element of thier Type. This usually takes at least one week of hard training to accomplish. They are even capable of imbuing their arrows with either Celestial or Infernal energy, some can even do both, though not at the same time. Their bows are also the focus from which the attacks like Mana Bolt come from. Should they be forced to fight in close combat, their weapon of choice is a pair of long daggers. As a rule, High Elves prefer not to fight, but will do it if ordered. When fighting they will put distance between their enemies, erect a magical barrier and shoot from behind that. They use their intelligence to find out just how much force behind a shot they should put.


High Elves, despite losing the plant element, are still in tune with nature. They know what nature is trying to tell them and are capable of interpreting the signs. They are in fact so in tune, that using Balance of Nature, their plant element lasts twice as long as others who might use it. During the War, High Elves made excellent assassins. Their range could often exceed enemy snipers, and when hiding in the forest, it was very unlikely that they would be found. The High Elf was known for being able to take out an enemy commander the only warning being an arrow growing from the targets head.


Thresholding into a High Elf is rare, but occurs in those who have a very magical and very elven ancestory.
